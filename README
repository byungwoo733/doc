- Supported Platforms and Operating Systems

  Operating System         Platform
  RHEL7.3                  x86_64
  RHEL7.4                  x86_64
  RHEL7.5                  x86_64

- VEOS doesn't support Linux suspend and resume. Please do not suspend and
  resume your Linux/x86 machine where VEs are installed. When you suspend and
  resume the Linux/x86 machine, Linux will be down in the worst case, such
  as kernel panic etc. This causes your important data loss.

- VEOS doesn't support Linux which works on any virtual machine, such as QEMU
  etc. VEOS can work correctly only on Linux which works directly on the
  physical machine.
